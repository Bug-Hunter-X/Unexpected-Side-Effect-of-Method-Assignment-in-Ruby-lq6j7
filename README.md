This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ruby related to method assignment.  The `value` method in the `MyClass` class returns the instance variable `@value`. Assigning a new value via `my_object.value = 20` unexpectedly modifies the object's internal state rather than returning a new object, which can lead to unintended consequences if not understood.  The solution provides an alternative approach to avoid this unexpected behavior.
